# What is MediaChannel?
In the most simplist of terms, MediaChannel is an ongoing project that enables users to provide and consume web content, known as media objects.

At it's core, MediaChannel is a website aggregator that consumes information and formats it into
a layout known as channels and media objects. The project's aim is to allow other applications and websites to consume this information with an easy to use API.

Channels are basically the containers of Media Objects translated to computer format, just as Websites are the containers for the information we humans digest.

Media Objects are the smallest building blocks. These are often things like comments, twitter or blog posts, songs, movies, books, and the list goes on.


The reason I started these projects was to allow people to consume THEIR content WHEN they want and HOW they want.
This opens the door to a brand new world of possibilities.

The primary objective is to make the web more open and accessible regardless of the software or device that people use.

Motto: People need to see past what it is, for what it can be.

# Examples:
  * Watch content from flash websites on your AppleTV.
  * Access content from your computer on the AppleTV without the need to be at your computer.
  * Get up to date show times right on your Calendar. (Google, iCal, Apple Watch, iPhone, Android, etc)
  * Get notifications when a movie hits your local theater.
  * Read RSS feeds from Websites that don't support them out of the box.
  * More coming soon

In the future, there will also be an authentication API to allow more personalized content, settings, and
content from subscription providers.
