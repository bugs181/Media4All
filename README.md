## WORK IN PROGRESS

# What is Media4All?
Media4All is an index list of projects that enable users to provide and consume web content, known as consumable
media objects.

The reason I started these projects was to allow people to consume THEIR content WHEN they want and HOW they want.
This opens the door to a brand new world of possibilities.

The primary objective is to make the web more open and accessible regardless of the software or device that people use.

Motto: People need to see past what it is, for what it can be.

# Examples:
  * Watch content from flash websites on your AppleTV.
  * Access content from your computer on the AppleTV without the need to be at your computer.
  * Get up to date show times right on your Calendar. (Google, iCal, Apple Watch, iPhone, Android, etc)
  * Get notifications when a movie hits your local theater.
  * More coming soon

In the future, there will also be an authentication API to allow more personalized content, settings, and
content from subscription providers.
