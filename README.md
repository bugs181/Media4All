## WORK IN PROGRESS

# What is Media4All?
Media4All is an index list of projects that enable users to provide and consume web content, known as consumeable
media objects.

The reason I started these projects was to allow people to consume THEIR content HOW they want.
This opens the door to a brand new world of possibilities.

The primary objective is to make the web more open and accessible regardless of the software or device that people use.

# Examples:
  * Watch content on your AppleTV from flash websites.
  * More coming soon

In the future, there will also be an authentication API to allow more personalized content, settings, and
content from subscription providers.

# Content (Consumable Media Objects):
* eBooks
* Movies
* TV Shows
* Songs
* Notes
